# Bintan-App
Bintan App is an app that can help people to explore Bintan Island, so they can feel explore like a native. The Idea is our team trying to understand user painpoint during enjoying Bintan Island. 

We found that people is get hard to find the best route, the best culinary in Bintan. We develop Route Map based to give best recommendation that we were trying to offer to the user. 

The Technology we used: 
- UIKit > Layouting Screen
- MapKit & Core Location > Route Based handling
- Core Data > Soon to be develop. because currently we were not putting our data into cloud. only image data that we put into cloud, the rest are not yet.
